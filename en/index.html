            To all current and former members of the University community:
            Teaching and research staff, students, administrative and service
            staff, as well as associated staff of institutes and research
            groups, departments, faculties and unions,
            <span class="has-text-weight-bold">
              from the collective #NotMyUniversityليست_جامعتي #, the Spanish
              Inter-University Network of Solidarity with Palestine, appalled by
              the information coming from Palestine, and Gaza in particular </span
            >, we call on you to sign this manifesto denouncing the collective
            punishment that Israel is inflicting, with the complicit silence, if
            not acquiescence, of the international community, especially the
            European Union, on 2.3 million defenceless and innocent people. We
            call on the university community throughout Spain to join us in our
            firm rejection of the argument that the murders and kidnappings of
            civilians committed by Hamas - which we unequivocally condemn - can
            justify the blockade, the indiscriminate attacks and the invasion of
            Gaza, as well as the unpunished actions of the settlers who
            terrorise the population of the West Bank and East Jerusalem,
            actions that international humanitarian law considers to be flagrant
            war crimes and crimes against humanity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The toll is already staggering: in one month, the number of
            displaced persons has exceeded one million and the death toll has
            risen to more than 10,000. Health, education and housing
            infrastructures throughout Gaza have been destroyed and more than
            30,000 people have been injured. Among the institutions attacked and
            destroyed are the Islamic University of Gaza and Al-Aqsa University,
            partners of a dozen Spanish universities in teaching and research
            projects. Our colleagues in all the Palestinian universities with
            which we have international mobility agreements call on us to
            denounce these crimes and demand that our authorities put pressure
            on Israel to comply with international law.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also call on the entire university community to reflect on the
            fact that the violation of the national and human rights of the
            Palestinian people as a whole, the violence and the unbearable daily
            life and lack of future for Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank,
            East Jerusalem and the refugee camps in Lebanon, Jordan and Syria,
            only fuel violence and extremism. Each new generation of children
            grows up deprived of basic necessities, including the right to
            education and a decent future, with lifelong physical and
            psychological consequences. We must prevent this situation from
            continuing to the point of extinction, and we therefore encourage
            the entire university community to take all possible measures to put
            pressure on institutions and governments.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Palestinian people are victims of decades of suffering, of a
            systematic policy of expulsion, dispossession, apartheid and
            annihilation by Israel, the original cause of which is the denial of
            their existence for 75 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given the scale of the ongoing genocide, we ask for your signature
            to demand that the authorities of Spanish universities make a public
            and explicit declaration of support for the Palestinian people, in
            accordance with the guiding principles of the university statutes
            and the long history of our universities taking a stance in defence
            of peace, justice and the dignity of all peoples, which are also the
            basis of our university life.
